# Employee Burnout Analysis and prediction
 
## Overview

The Employee Burnout Prediction System uses regression techniques to analyze factors such as workload, mental fatigue, job demands, and work-life balance to predict employee burnout. By identifying employees at risk of burnout, organizations can take proactive measures to improve employee well-being, reduce turnover, and enhance productivity.

## Model Development
The burnout prediction model uses regression techniques to predict the likelihood of burnout based on input features. The key steps involved in model development are as follows:

Data Collection:
A dataset containing factors influencing employee burnout, such as workload, mental fatigue, and work-life balance, is collected.

Data Cleaning:
Missing values are handled, and categorical data is encoded. Features are normalized and scaled for uniformity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations are created to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between features and burnout risk.

Feature Selection:
Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (burnout risk).

Model Training:
Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression) are trained using the cleaned dataset.

Model Evaluation:
Performance is assessed using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² to ensure the model's predictive accuracy.
